<h1>E-shop</h1>
<p>
My Django framework training project - e-commerce application for clothing store.
</p>
<p>
**Still under construction.**
</p>
<p> 
Application allows different types of products. Each type of product can have different attributes.
Products can also have different variants e.g. color, size. The user can select a product feature, like color, 
and the application will dynamically filter the product variants with this feature. When all features
are selected product may be added to the cart and then ordered.
</p>
<p> 
While the frontend is not the primary focus of this project, Bootstrap and some basic JS
is used to make it look nicer.
