<h1>MyShop</h1>
<p>
My Django framework training project - e-commerce application for clothing store.
</p>
<p>
**Still under construction.**
</p>
<p> 
Application allows different categories of products. Each category of product can have unique attributes.
One product can also have different variants e.g. color, size. The user can select a product feature, like color, 
and the application will dynamically filter available product variants with this feature. When all features
are selected product may be added to the cart and then ordered.
User accounts are implemented. Logged-in user can rate and comment on products, view past orders and have order data
filled in automatically. Accounts must be confirmed by activation link sent on provided email address. Password reset
is possible by email.
</p>
<p> 
While the frontend is not the primary focus of this project, Bootstrap 5 and some basic JS
is used to make it look nicer.
